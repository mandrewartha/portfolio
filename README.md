# Portfolio

## User Story
AS A starting web developer,
I WANT to display my completed projects,
SO THAT I can meet prospective employers

## Description
In this project HTML and CSS were used to create a reactive portfolio website. To create the site, I used the CSS format Bootstrap. The links in the navbar are interactive. The pictures in the carousel are links to specific GitHub repostitories.
